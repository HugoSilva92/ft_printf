# Grade 100/125

First time user variadic functions, was cool to see for the first time,
a function that could take various variables (with any type that we gave it).

To be real, I didn't even look to the bonus.

I'm currently working a full-time job and have one day to fully dedicate to school.

That doesn't mean that in the future I won't come back to try to do it.

Subject of the project included on repository.
